                We are the University of Manchester Hiking Club, bringing together students who love getting outdoors and meeting new people. As a society under The University of Manchester Student Union, we welcome students from all backgrounds and experience levels to join our adventures and connect with like-minded individuals no matter which university you attend in Manchester. Every weekend during term time, we organise hikes to stunning locations including the Lake District and North Wales, plus we run weekly socials to keep our community connected throughout the week. Whether you&apos;re a complete beginner taking your first steps on the trails or an experienced hiker looking for new challenges, our inclusive approach means everyone has a place in our community. We believe that hiking is for everyone, and we&apos;re here to help you discover the joy of exploring the outdoors with new friends while building lasting connections both on and off the trails.
