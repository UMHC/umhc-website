            description="Rain is fairly common on a hike and therefore having a waterproof coat is a requirement for our trips. Coats are measured using a rating value called the Hydrostatic Head (HH) which measures how waterproof it is. The higher the number, the more waterproof the coat is. Lots of companies advertise their coats as waterproof when they actually have a fairly low HH rating (~3000mm), a coat can be considered waterproof against heavy rain and extended use when it's HH rating is above 10,000mm and then considered suitable for extreme weather when it's HH rating is above 20,000mm. It's recommended that you have a coat with a HH rating of 10,000mm or greater however these can be expensive and are not necessarily required as long as the coat is somewhat waterproof. The minimum HH rating is 1,500mm which is considered suitable for light showers."
